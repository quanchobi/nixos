# Quanchobi's Nixos Config
My personal nixos config. Defines configurations of all of the machines I use nixos on, all wrapped up in a flake.

Additionally home-manager to define a user environment for both terminal only and gui machines in home.

This is designed for personal use. You are free to do whatever you want with what you find here, but I cannot promise it will be useful.
